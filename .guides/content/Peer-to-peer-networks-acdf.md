In a peer-to-peer network all of the computers are connected together without any one computer controlling access to the network.
Each computer acts as both a client and a server and can communicate directly with the others.


Through sharing rights granted by the users any computer can share the programs of another, save data onto their hard disk and use printers connected to them.

Security is distributed and the users of each computer have to be able to grant access rights to its resources and allot passwords.
