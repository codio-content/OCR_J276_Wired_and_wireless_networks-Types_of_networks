## Client-server

- More expensive – need a dedicated file server which is usually a more high-powered PC.
- Need to buy a network operating system and learn how to use it.
- May have to employ a network manager.
- Data and programs are saved on the central file server and are more secure.
- The server manages access to the network and gives access rights to different users e.g. whether they can see, read, write to, modify, delete certain files.
- Higher performance as the server is handling all of data storage and transfer an printing and so client computers are free to carry out user related tasks.
- Security is high as it is not set by each computer user for individual machines.
- Backup is central and only the file server needs to be backed up as that is where the data is stored.
- If the server crashes then programs and data cannot be accessed and may be lost for all users.

## Peer-to-peer

- Cheaper and easier to install and does not require an expensive server.
- Do not have to buy an expensive network operating system and learn how to use it.
- Easier to maintain – do not need to employ a network manager.
- If you have work saved on another computer’s hard disk drive it may be lost if that computer crashes or a user deletes it.
- Each user has to know how to grant and maintain share rights to their computer.
- Often poor performance as another computer may be accessing your hard disk drive to run programs or load and save data.
- Security is often a problem. If password protection is employed, anyone who knows the password can access a shared resource. If no passwords are used, anyone who can access the workgroup can access shared resources.
- No central backup. Each hard disk drive must be backed up independently.
