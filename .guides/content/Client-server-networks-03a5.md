In a client-server network there are two types of computers: the computers that control access to the network (servers) and the computers on which the users work (clients).


In a client-server network the server controls access to the network.

From the client machines, the users log into the network servers in order to be able to access programs and peripherals and save data on the servers.
The server is responsible for the security of the network and users have to log in with a user name and password.
