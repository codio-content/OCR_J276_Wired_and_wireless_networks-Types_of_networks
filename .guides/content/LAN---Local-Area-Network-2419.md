Your school probably has a LAN as it allows computers in a single site or within a small geographical area such to connect with each other.
LANs are commonly used in the home, schools, office buildings or a group of buildings on a local site.

A LAN in an office building allows the computers to communicate and share resources such as printers and internet connections.


Local area networks are relatively easy to set up and manage as they are owned by a single organisation.
