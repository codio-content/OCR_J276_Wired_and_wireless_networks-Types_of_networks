In this lesson we will look at the sharing of data and resources and the roles of computers in computer networks.

The sharing of resources and data between computers has revolutionised the lives of practically every inhabitant of the world.

The mobile phone network, allowing voice and text messaging has allowed people to communicate for the first time across continents with no traditional telephone infrastructure.
Just think about a few of the ways you make use of computer networks -  sending and receiving emails, video conferencing, online shopping, streaming music and videos, social networking, researching material for your homework and handing it in online.
All these would be impossible without computer networks.

Networks vary in size and scale from a personal area network (PAN) that allows an individualâ€™s personal devices such as mobile phone, tablet, television and computer to communicate and share data to networks spanning the globe.

A personal area network allows the devices of a single or several people to communicate over small distances. The range depends on the method of communication used.
